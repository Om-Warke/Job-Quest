JobQuest: Your Path to a New Career
JobQuest is a comprehensive job portal designed to bridge the gap between job seekers and employers. Our platform provides a seamless and intuitive experience for both Candidates and Recruiters, streamlining the entire hiring process from application to offer.

Core Features
For Candidates:

Easy Registration & Login: Create a secure profile with your skills to get started.

Browse Job Listings: View all available job postings in one place.

Simple Application Process: Easily apply for jobs by providing your details and resume link.

Track Your Applications: Monitor the real-time status of your applications (Pending, Accepted, Rejected) on your dashboard.

This looks like a request to summarize the project for a README file on GitHub. I'll need to pull information from the various project files to give a comprehensive, yet easy-to-understand summary.

Here's a breakdown of the key information I'll need to include:

Project Name: JobQuest

Purpose: The core function of the application is to connect job seekers and employers.

Target Audience/Roles: Two distinct user roles: Candidates (job seekers) and Recruiters (employers).

Key Features for Candidates: Register, log in, view job listings, apply for jobs, and track application status.

Key Features for Recruiters: Register, log in, post new jobs, delete jobs, and manage candidate applications (accept/reject).

Technology Stack:

Frontend: React, React Router, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, Vite, and Axios for API calls.

Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Security, MongoDB, Lombok, and JWT (as a commented-out example).

I'll synthesize this information into a clear and concise summary for a README file.### JobQuest: Your Path to a New Career
